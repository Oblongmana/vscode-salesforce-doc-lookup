# VSCode Salesforce Doc Lookup

_Pre-release Extension_

This is a re-implementation of my old ST3 extension in VSCode: (https://github.com/Oblongmana/sublime-salesforce-reference). See the Roadmap below
for details on aims. Notes can be found in NOTES.md. Any contributions welcome

## Notable Differences to the original ST3 version
1. There's no caching yet - every time you run a command, it retrieves the relevant doc table of contents from scratch. Adding caching is on the [Roadmap](#roadmap)
2. The original plugin gave a list of certain nodes at a relatively low level of detail, due to technical limitations in Sublime -
    e.g. searching for "String" in the Apex Doc would give you "String Methods". As in VSCode can now show a breadcrumb in the picker, the same search will now
    produce "String Class", "String Methods", and all of the actual methods under these headers!
3. The All Doc Types search is gone - this won't be reimplemented until caching is added - performance would be horrifying, in addition to needing a more
    sophisticated breadcrumb strategy.


## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement Basic Visualforce Reference
- [ ] Implement Basic Service Console Reference
- [ ] Implement Basic Metadata Reference
- [ ] Implement some kind of on-load caching, as the old ST3 plugin had
- [ ] Implement context-based searching - where you can search for the thing that's under your cursor in your editor
- [ ] Write some tests ðŸ˜±
- [ ] Implement ALL DOC searching - combine all the things together. Will be extremely reliant on caching existing
- [ ] Examine the feasibility of displaying doc in VSCode. Want to avoid showing a full-blown web browser ofc.
