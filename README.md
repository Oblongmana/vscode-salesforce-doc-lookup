# VSCode Salesforce Doc Lookup

_Pre-release Extension_

Repository Home: (https://github.com/Oblongmana/vscode-salesforce-doc-lookup)

This is a re-implementation of my old ST3 extension in VSCode: (https://github.com/Oblongmana/sublime-salesforce-reference). See the Roadmap below
for details on aims. Notes can be found in NOTES.md. Contributions welcome, though I suggest opening an issue ticket on github to discuss before hand.

_**Please Note**: this is a community-made plugin, and is not affiliated with Salesforce. If the extension breaks,
please open a github issue here to let me know, there's a chance Salesforce may change it's doc approach, necessitating
an update to the plugin_

## Installing

Currently this is in pre-release, and is not published to the VSCode Marketplace. You can still install it however! Go to https://github.com/Oblongmana/vscode-salesforce-doc-lookup/releases
and download your desired version as a vsix file. Install it using the following command

    code --install-extension [path to the downloaded vsix]

Alternatively, if you want to build it yourself, clone the repo and follow the instructions at https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#packaging-extensions
to bundle and install.

## Current Features
### Lookup Apex Reference Documentation

Adds a new command: "Salesforce Reference: Apex"

## Limitations, Known Issues, and Notable Differences to the original ST3 version
1. Because Salesforce's Doc website is Angular app that dynamically loads content into the page after the page itself has loaded, anchor links
    appear to be managed in such a way that the Angular app (rather than the browser) handles the scrolling to the requested item.
    e.g. https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_methods_system_string.htm#apex_System_String_substring - the
    section after the `#` is the anchor link, trying to take you directly to substring. This Salesforce Angular App functionality may play a little
    poorly with some adblockers such as "uBlock Origin". If you find commands are not scrolling you to the item you request, this may be fixed
    by disabling your adblocker on the Salesforce doc site, if you are comfortable with doing so.
2. There's no caching yet - every time you run a command, it retrieves the relevant doc table of contents from scratch. Adding caching is on the [Roadmap](#roadmap)
3. The original plugin gave a list of certain nodes at a relatively low level of detail, due to technical limitations in Sublime -
    e.g. searching for "String" in the Apex Doc would give you "String Methods". As in VSCode can now show a breadcrumb in the picker, the same search will now
    produce "String Class", "String Methods", and all of the actual methods under these headers!
4. The All Doc Types search is gone - this won't be reimplemented until caching is added - performance would be horrifying, in addition to needing a more
    sophisticated breadcrumb strategy.


## Roadmap
In rough priority order
- [ ] Implement Basic Visualforce Reference
- [ ] Implement Basic Service Console Reference
- [ ] Implement Basic Metadata Reference
- [ ] Implement some kind of on-load caching, as the old ST3 plugin had
- [ ] Bundle the extension to reduce size (https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension)
- [ ] Implement context-based searching - where you can search for the thing that's under your cursor in your editor
- [ ] Write some tests ðŸ˜±
- [ ] Implement ALL DOC searching - combine all the things together. Will be extremely reliant on caching existing
- [ ] Publish publicly
- [ ] Examine the feasibility of displaying doc in VSCode. Want to avoid showing a full-blown web browser ofc.
