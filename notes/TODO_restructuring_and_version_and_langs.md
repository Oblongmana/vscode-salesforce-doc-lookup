# Restructuring, adding Version config, and lang config (2022-07)
Notes to self üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Aims
- Hoping to restructure things to be less locked in generally
  - not only less locked in to Atlas/Aura doc types,
  - but also potentially less locked in to Salesforce itself, for easier reuse on some other side projects
- Want to make sure reference items are as portable as possible, in particular:
  - Need to be able to generically call the (names TBD) getUrl() and getHtml() methods without knowledge of subclass/impl. Gives us max flexibility if we e.g. want to combine lists in future without type checks and other nonsense
  - The cached data needs to be uniformly serializable/deserializable regardless of type, if possible, though there are necessarily some compromises/oddities. The simple and likely way to do this is to break our data out into a Memento (as in the pattern) that can be generated from/rehydrated into, that is much like our existing QuickPickItem based class - but without any extra implementation specific TOP-LEVEL data. Instead, implementation specific stuff can go into a KV store called "data" that the base memento has
    - The ReferenceItem can be as complicated as it likes, but the ReferenceItemMemento should have a uniform definition
- Add support for alternate languages where possible - Certainly for Apex Dev doc, SF have historically produce ja-jp, though they appear to be 2 releases behind at the moment!
- Add support for alternate SF API versions where possible (e.g. v54 = 236, so apex atlas is atlas.en-us.236.0.apexref.meta)

## TODO (not exhaustive, just making sure some things I don't want to forget are written down!)
- [ ] Expose Version and Lang as config.
  - Making the choice not to allow this per request as this puts too too many menus between the user and the doc
  - [ ] However, I'd like to also include commands for quickly modifying this preference without needing to find it in the settings, for version switching on the fly
  - [ ] May also need to set up e.g. a language fallback option - though note that I'll hardcode an ultimate fallback of en-us
- [ ] Work out how to notify users of change sensibly for the major version upgrade. 90% sure they've added that ability since I last looked however many years ago
- [ ] Run through the other doc types and add them as options

## Nice to have at some point
- [ ] Would be good to signal to the user when the last retrieve date for a doc type was, possibly also the version it was retrieved in
